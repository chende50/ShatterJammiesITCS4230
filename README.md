Walkthrough
It is time to get the perfect gem for the player's lover! After entering room one, jump across the various still platforms until reaching the zombie at the end. Once at the zombie, deflect the oncoming projectiles twice to defeat the zombie. Collect the crystal and enter room two. In room two, jump across the moving platforms. Deflect projectiles and successfully kill the zombies on the moving platforms. Collect the second crystal and enter room three. Now the player must scale upwards, jumping to each of the higher platforms using their new double jump. Some platforms need to be broken down for the player to advance. Hit these crystal towers to shatter them and continue upwards. Defeat the beetles as they come closer until you reach the top and get the final crystal.
